# `simplify`: orchestration recipe

Dispatch shape, composition rule, Reviewer audit contract, fix sequencing, and behavior gate for the `simplify` skill. Read alongside `../SKILL.md` Phase 1 / 2 / 3.

## Phase 1: diff scope resolution (shell snippet)

```bash
# Resolve a base ref. Print "" and exit 1 if none resolves.
resolve_base() {
  for candidate in \
    "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main 2>/dev/null)" \
    "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/master 2>/dev/null)" \
    "$(git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null)" \
    "$(git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null)" \
    "$(git rev-parse '@{upstream}' 2>/dev/null)"; do
    if [ -n "$candidate" ]; then
      printf '%s\n' "$candidate"
      return 0
    fi
  done
  return 1
}

# Primary path.
if base="$(resolve_base)"; then
  diff="$(git --no-pager diff "$base")"
elif git rev-parse --verify HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  if git rev-parse --verify 'HEAD^' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Committed history exists, no base resolves -> abort.
    printf 'simplify: committed history exists but no base ref resolves\n' >&2
    printf '  re-invoke with explicit base: simplify against <ref>\n' >&2
    exit 2
  else
    # HEAD is the root commit -> working tree only is the full scope.
    printf 'simplify: scope: working-tree only, on root commit\n' >&2
    diff="$(git --no-pager diff HEAD)"
  fi
else
  # Unborn HEAD or no git context -> caller supplies files.
  diff=""
fi

# Empty diff after all valid resolutions -> exit 11.
[ -z "$diff" ] && exit 11
```

**Explicit-base override**: when the user invokes `simplify against <ref>`, the orchestrator bypasses `resolve_base` and runs `git --no-pager diff "<ref>"` directly. The `<ref>` is any revision spec git accepts (`HEAD~5`, a SHA, a branch name, a tag).

## Phase 2: single `task` call dispatch shape

The orchestrator issues a single `task` tool call with a `tasks` array of three items, never three sequential messages. Each item receives a prompt built as:

```
<axis prompt from references/<axis>.md, verbatim>

---

DIFF:
<captured diff from Phase 1>
```

Independence argument the orchestrator must include in the spawn message:

> "Three agents dispatched in parallel. Axes are disjoint by construction: reuse-axis owns Graft (existing-utility detection), quality-axis owns Excess + Sprawl on code shape, efficiency-axis owns Excess + Sprawl on execution cost. All three agents are read-only; none edits files; none reads or writes shared mutable state."

Agent type for each invocation: `Explore` (read-only).

## Phase 3: composition, audit, fix

### Composition

After all three findings lists return, merge by `{file, line}`. Tag each finding with its axis. When two axes report the same `{file, line}` with structurally identical patterns, deduplicate: keep the finding once, attribute to the first reporter, note the second axis as a co-signer.

### Reviewer audit (single adjudication authority)

Dispatch a Reviewer agent (also `Explore`-typed, read-only) with:
- the composed findings list,
- the original diff,
- the axis prompts from `references/{reuse,quality,efficiency}.md`.

Reviewer audit charter (four checks):
1. **Completeness**: did the three axes between them cover every diff hunk that warrants attention? Flag systematic blind spots.
2. **Consistency**: do any findings contradict each other (e.g., "extract this into a helper" vs "inline this helper")? Flag and resolve.
3. **Accuracy**: for each finding, verify the citation. Discard findings whose `path:line` does not match the diff or whose `existing-utility` does not exist.
4. **Scope**: flag findings that propose changes outside the diff's blast radius. Discard.

The Reviewer's output is the **validated survivor set**. The orchestrator applies survivors and drops non-survivors; no re-litigation in either direction.

If the survivor set is empty after a non-empty raw findings list, exit 12.

### Fix sequencing

Group survivors by `issue-class`. Apply in this order, one atomic commit per class:

1. **Duplicate commit**: apply all reuse-axis survivors (and any other axis survivors flagged `issue-class: duplicate`).
2. **Excess-surface commit**: apply all quality-axis + efficiency-axis survivors flagged `issue-class: excess-surface`.
3. **Structure commit**: apply all quality-axis + efficiency-axis survivors flagged `issue-class: structure`.

Commit message format follows the baseline `<git>` charter (capitalized imperative subject, 50 chars target and 72 hard, no trailing period); recommended:

```
Remove <class> from <scope>

<2-4 lines describing the survivors applied in this commit, citing
file:line pairs>

```

A commit that would bundle survivors from more than one class is split before merge (exit 15).

## Behavior gate (after every commit)

After each fix commit, run the repo-native verifier per the matrix derived from the project's manifest in this order: a task-runner target (`just test`, `make test`), then the ecosystem's own test command (`cargo test`, `pytest`, `npm test`, `dune runtest`, `go test ./...`), or the equivalent for the current language. On red:

```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
```

Surface the failure mode (exit 13) and stop the simplify run for the affected commit. Other class commits already landed remain.

## Post-fix audit (no new bloat)

After the final commit, audit the simplify patch itself for unneeded surface, duplicated logic, structure without cause, or a broken consumer contract. Any hit → revert the entire simplify chain via `git revert <first-simplify-commit>^..HEAD --no-edit` and exit 14. The orchestrator may re-plan and re-invoke.

## Exit code summary (matches SKILL.md)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| 0 | Survivors applied, behavior gate green, no new bloat |
| 11 | Empty diff after all Phase 1 resolutions |
| 12 | Survivor set empty after Reviewer audit |
| 13 | Behavior gate red on a fix commit; that commit reverted |
| 14 | Post-fix audit caught new bloat; chain reverted |
| 15 | Mixed-class commit detected; split required before merge |
