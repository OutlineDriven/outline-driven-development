# Apply code review findings (after `/review`)

Load this reference after `/review` finishes, when `/work` or another caller must apply fixes before the Residual Work Gate.

`/review` is invoked here with `mode:agent`, so it is **review-only** in this context — it reports findings and writes artifacts and does not mutate the checkout, commit, push, or file tickets. **The caller owns apply/fix policy.** (In its own default/interactive mode the review applies safe fixes itself; that path does not apply here.)

## Consume the completed review (do not re-run it)

This reference loads **after** review has run. In the `/work` shipping flow, step 3a already invoked `/review`; this apply step **consumes that output** — do not start a second review, which would waste reviewer dispatches and risk overwriting the artifact the Residual Work Gate reconciles.

Reuse the review output already in hand:

- Parsed JSON (`status`, `actionable_findings`, `findings`, `artifact_path`, `run_id`) **or** the markdown Actionable Findings summary captured by the caller.
- Run artifact dir: `/tmp/odin/review/<run-id>/` (`review.json`, per-reviewer JSON for `why_it_matters`).

If `status` is `failed`, stop shipping and surface `reason`. If `degraded`, note partial reviewer coverage before applying anything.

### Fallback: invoke review only for cold callers

Only when the caller reached this file **without** already running review (no review output in hand): invoke `/review` once, then proceed to apply. Do not invoke when the caller already ran review (e.g., `/work` shipping step 3a).

Invoke the skill explicitly; do not treat a casual "review my changes" prompt as a substitute unless the harness routed it to `/review`.

```
/review mode:agent plan:<plan-path> base:<merge-base-or-ref>
```

- `mode:agent`: JSON output (`review.json` + primary JSON response) for programmatic parsing; same review pipeline as default.
- `plan:`: when Phase 1 used a plan file (requirements completeness).
- `base:`: when the diff base is already resolved on the current checkout; omit when reviewing a PR number/URL or standalone current branch.

## Inputs for apply

- `actionable_findings` from JSON, or the Actionable Findings section from markdown.
- Full finding detail when needed: `review.json` / artifact `findings`, or `{reviewer}.json` for `why_it_matters` and `evidence`.
- Stable finding `#`: reuse in residual sinks and subagent prompts.

## What to apply

Default to applying every actionable finding. Applying is a reversible edit to a tracked tree; diffs are reviewed before handoff and tests run after — so leaving a clear, reversible fix unapplied "to be safe" is the failure mode, not the safe choice. Bias to act:

- Apply any finding with a concrete `suggested_fix` that is a clear improvement. `confidence` and `autofix_class` tell you what to prioritize and what to flag, not whether you may apply: `autofix_class` is signal, **never permission**.
- Push back — keep the finding, don't apply — when the reviewer is wrong; note why.
- High-risk surfaces require a verification plan before apply. Auth/authz, public or cross-service contracts/schema, and concurrency findings need a written plan that names: (1) the specific trust-boundary cases or compatibility checks that will exercise the change, (2) the rollback step if a check fails, and (3) any residual risk that remains unverified. If the review output does not supply this, do not apply the finding; record it as residual and surface it to the user. Lower-risk findings keep the bias-to-apply rule.

There is no precondition safety checklist for lower-risk fixes — a code-review fix is a reversible edit, so downside is controlled after the fact (diff review + tests), not by gating the apply.

**Evidence still matches the code** — the fix subagent confirms at `file:line` before editing. The orchestrator does **not** open files just to decide eligibility or dispatch.

## What to defer (to the Residual Work Gate)

- `autofix_class: advisory` — report-only.
- Findings with no concrete `suggested_fix` to act on.
- Findings whose right fix depends on a design or product decision — architecture direction, contract shape, or a behavior change needing sign-off.

Surface what was deferred and why; never silently drop.

## Execution — orchestrator batches, subagents apply

The orchestrator **does not investigate findings** (no pre-read of cited files to judge complexity or inline vs subagent). That would spend the context window you are trying to protect.

Orchestrator owns: parse review output → **eligibility filter on JSON fields only** → build batches → dispatch fix subagents → review diffs → tests → Residual Work Gate. Do not commit; the finalizer owns commit packaging.

Fix subagents own: read `file:line`, confirm evidence still matches, apply or skip with reason, return summary.

### Default: batched fix subagents

After eligibility filtering, **dispatch subagents for all remaining applicable findings** unless the optional inline shortcut below applies. Do not classify findings by complexity in the parent thread.

**Batching (primary rule — group by file):**

1. Sort applicable findings by severity (P0 first).
2. **Group by `file`.** All eligible findings on the same file → **one subagent** (it loads the file once and works through its `#` list in severity order).
3. **Parallel waves:** batches with **disjoint file sets** may run in parallel (same worktree / shared-directory rules as Phase 1 Step 4 in `SKILL.md`).
4. **Same file, many findings:** keep one subagent per file. If the prompt would exceed a comfortable size (~8 findings), split into **serial** subagent passes on that file (first batch highest severity, then next batch after merge or after the prior agent returns).
5. **Cross-file coupling:** do not merge unrelated files into one subagent just to reduce agent count — file grouping is the default. Only co-batch multiple files when findings explicitly reference the same small edit surface (rare); when in doubt, separate by file.

**Subagent prompt (per batch):** the assigned findings only (`#`, severity, file, line, title, `suggested_fix`, `requires_verification`; add `why_it_matters` from `{reviewer}.json` in the run artifact when useful), plus:
- Work through assigned `#` in severity order; at each `file:line`, skip with a one-line reason if evidence no longer matches.
- Apply the mechanical bar from § What to apply / What not to apply — skip anything that needs design judgment.
- Do not re-run `/review`.
- Shared-directory fallback: do not stage or commit — return which `#` were applied or skipped and which files changed.

**After each wave:** orchestrator reviews diffs (scope = assigned `#` only), runs tests (`requires_verification: true` on any applied finding → at least targeted tests; multi-file → broader suite). Do not commit; the finalizer owns commit packaging. Repeat until all batches complete.

### Optional inline shortcut (skip subagent spawn)

Use **only** when **all** of the following hold:

- Exactly **one** eligible finding after JSON filtering, **and**
- The orchestrator **already** has that file's relevant region in context from Phase 2 work this session (no new Read/Grep expedition).

Otherwise dispatch a subagent — even for a single finding. When unsure, dispatch.

### Summary (required)

Report: batches dispatched, `#` applied vs skipped (with reasons from subagents), artifact path, tests run.

## Handoff to Residual Work Gate

Any actionable finding not applied in this pass is **residual work** — proceed to the Residual Work Gate with an updated count. Do not re-invoke `/review` solely to re-apply the same findings unless the diff changed materially after fixes.
