# TypeScript, jest/vitest deletion patterns

TypeScript with `strict: true` is a static-guarantee language. The compiler proves that interfaces have the fields they declare, that functions return their declared types (modulo `any`/`unknown`/casts), and that exhaustive matches handle every case. **Tests that assert these properties catch no bug the compiler does not**; delete them.

The carve-out: if the codebase uses `any`, `unknown`, or unchecked JSON parses, the static guarantee leaks and shape tests at the leak boundary become real-bug tests. Use Zod or io-ts at the boundary instead, then delete the shape tests.

## Delete

### Interface field presence

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

it("user has id and name", () => {
  const u: User = { id: 1, name: "alice" };
  expect(u.id).toBe(1);
  expect(u.name).toBe("alice");
});
```

The compiler already proves `User` has `id: number` and `name: string`. The test is a tautology that verifies object literal assignment, not behavior.

### Constructor output assertion

```ts
class UserService {
  constructor(public repo: UserRepository, public logger: Logger) {}
}

it("constructor stores repo and logger", () => {
  const s = new UserService(mockRepo, mockLogger);
  expect(s.repo).toBe(mockRepo);
  expect(s.logger).toBe(mockLogger);
});
```

`public` parameter properties are a TS feature, the compiler proves the assignment. Delete.

### Identity passthrough / re-export

```ts
it("getUser returns the input id wrapped", () => {
  expect(wrapId(42)).toEqual({ id: 42 });
});
```

If `wrapId` does no validation or transformation worth testing, the test describes the type signature `(n: number) => { id: number }`, which the compiler already enforces.

### Mocked-everything test

```ts
it("service.getUser calls repo.findById", () => {
  const repo = { findById: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 1 }) };
  const service = new UserService(repo);
  const result = await service.getUser(1);
  expect(repo.findById).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
  expect(result).toEqual({ id: 1 });
});
```

This test asserts that the mock was called with the value the test passed and returned the fixture the test set up. It exposes no real bug surface. Replace it with a real-DB integration test or delete it.

## Keep

### Runtime boundary validation (where TS strict leaks)

```ts
it("parseUserPayload rejects malformed JSON shape", () => {
  expect(() => parseUserPayload(JSON.parse('{"name": null}'))).toThrow();
});
```

`JSON.parse` returns `any`, the compiler cannot help here. The test verifies the runtime guard at the boundary. Keep.

### HTTP contract

```ts
it("POST /users returns 400 on missing email", async () => {
  const res = await request(app).post("/users").send({ name: "x" });
  expect(res.status).toBe(400);
});
```

Protocol contract, the type system does not check HTTP semantics. Keep.

### Discriminated-union exhaustiveness (when relying on runtime check)

```ts
it("handlePayment returns error for unknown method", () => {
  // @ts-expect-error, runtime check, not compile-time
  expect(handlePayment({ method: "crypto" })).toEqual({ ok: false });
});
```

If the union has a runtime fallback for forward-compat, the test verifies the fallback. Keep.

### Security invariant

```ts
it("admin endpoint requires auth", async () => {
  const res = await request(app).get("/admin");
  expect(res.status).toBe(401);
});
```

Always keep.
