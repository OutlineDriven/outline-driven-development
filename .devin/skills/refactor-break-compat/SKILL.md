# Breaking refactors

## Contract

| Field | Bound contract |
|---|---|
| Trigger | Modernizing APIs, removing compat shims, killing feature flags, rewriting a subsystem cleanly. |
| Authority | Human-gated: requires explicit human invocation, previewing target and consequence before any irreversible deletion; otherwise reversible local: writes only VCS-tracked refactor targets; rollback is version control. No remote mutation. |
| Side effect | Deletes compat/adapter/flag code and rewrites every caller and test wholesale; local-delete-unrecoverable. |
| Done | Zero-residue grep, every caller on the new contract, any applicable persisted/external-boundary migration applied and verified before deleting the old path, tests green on new behavior (exit 0). |

## Refusals

- Additive refactors that keep the old path: rejected. This skill demolishes the old path. Use a regular refactor if the old path must survive.
- Shipping the intermediate state (half old, half new): rejected. Finish or revert to the version-control baseline.
- Widening scope beyond the demolition manifest: rejected. Do not widen scope to resolve a finding.

## Inputs

- Old API surface (required): the compat shims, legacy adapters, feature flags, version gates, and backward-compatible interfaces to demolish.
- New API surface (required): the target contract every caller must adopt.
- Scope (optional): file or module boundaries; when omitted, the blast-radius map determines scope.

## Procedure

1. Map the blast radius. Enumerate every file, module, and caller of the old shape using `ast-grep` or `rg`. This is the demolition manifest. **Done when**: the demolition manifest is complete.
2. Preview and confirm the demolition. Present the demolition manifest and the consequences to the user: every file and caller that will be deleted or rewritten, which tests will change, and which flags or config will be removed. If the old or new shape crosses a persisted or externally consumed boundary (for example, database schemas, event/message formats, queues, or public contracts), include an explicit migration/backfill and rollback or compatibility plan in the manifest. Present that plan and obtain confirmation before changing the boundary; the demolition-first rules do not authorize stranding persisted data or existing consumers. Wait for explicit human confirmation. **Done when**: the user confirms the demolition.
3. Apply and verify the step-2 migration/backfill plan before deleting the old path when the old or new shape crosses a persisted or externally consumed boundary. For live or remote systems, do not mutate them; give the human the exact action and wait for completion, then verify the result. If a required migration or verification remains incomplete, stop before deletion and report exit 3 (stalled migration). Once every applicable migration is verified, delete the old path: remove compat layers, adapters, legacy branches, and flags used only by the old path. Do not delete a flag that also controls the replacement or another live path. No commenting out. Delete. **Done when**: every applicable boundary migration is applied and verified before deletion, with the rollback path recorded; then the old path is deleted from every file in the manifest.
4. Rewrite every caller to the new contract. Migrate all references from step 1. After each batch, run the strongest static enumerator the project has (compiler or typechecker, including opt-in: `mypy`, `pyright`, `tsc --checkJs`, Sorbet). Never sufficient alone: no static pass sees reflective, dynamically dispatched, string-constructed, or generated references, nor code excluded from the build. Enumerate those by hand and name them in the report. **Done when**: every caller in the manifest is on the new contract and the static enumerator passes.
5. Rewrite tests to the new truth. Update assertions to the new behavior. Delete tests whose entire purpose was the old behavior. Add tests for the new contract where coverage is now thin. **Done when**: tests assert the new behavior and the old-behavior tests are deleted.
6. Exterminate ghosts. Grep for string references, config keys, env vars, doc links, error messages, and import paths naming the old API. Zero survivors. **Done when**: the grep returns nothing.
7. Strip dead weight. Remove imports, packages, dependencies, types, and dead files that only the old path needed. **Done when**: no dead weight from the old path remains.
8. Verify zero residue. A search for every old symbol, flag, and format name returns nothing. If it returns anything, return to step 4. **Done when**: the zero-residue search returns nothing.

## Failure and recovery

- Residue remains: after all in-scope step-4 fixes and a final step-8 search, old references still survive in code, tests, docs, or config. Report the survivors and stop with exit 1 (residue). Do not widen scope beyond the demolition manifest.
- Build or tests broken: migration incomplete, callers or assertions not yet on the new shape. Fix forward if within scope; if scope is exhausted, report the exact blockers and stop.
- Migration stalled or boundary migration incomplete: the codebase is half old and half new, a confirmed boundary migration/backfill has not run, or its verification is missing. Do not delete the old path while a required migration remains unverified; stop with exit 3 (stalled migration). Finish the local migration or have the human execute the remote action and return verification evidence; never ship the intermediate state.

Partial results are never reported as success. If any failure class triggers, the done predicate does not hold.

## Output

A migration report with blast-radius manifest, boundary-migration status and verification evidence (or not applicable), deleted artifacts list, caller-migration checklist, test-rewrite summary, zero-residue verification result, and final exit code (0 = clean demolition, 1 = residue, 2 = broken build, 3 = stalled or unverified boundary migration), ordered as listed.
