# Git-branchless recipes + decision rubric

Concrete command sequences for the workflows enforced by this skill. Each
recipe is verbatim — copy-paste, then adapt the placeholders. All examples
target `git-branchless 0.11.x`.

**Grounded: 2026-08-26**

Wiki source of truth: <https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki>

---

## Recipe 1: Start fresh work from main (detached HEAD)

```
git fetch origin
git switch --detach origin/main
# Edit files, then commit immediately. No branch yet.
git commit -m "Add first checkpoint"
```

Why detached: branchless tracks the commit in the smartlog with no branch
overhead. The branch is created later only when the work is ready to publish.

If `branchless.undo.createSnapshots=true` (default), the working copy is
snapshotted before the switch, so `git undo` can recover it.

---

## Recipe 2: Insert a fixup mid-stack

You realize commit B (three commits down) needs a one-line correction.

```
# 1. Make the change at HEAD as a marked fixup commit.
git commit --fixup <hash-of-B>

# 2. Squash it into B in-memory.
git move -s HEAD -d <hash-of-B> --fixup
```

Descendants of B are auto-restacked. No interactive rebase needed. Faster
alternative when you don't know which commit to target: install `git-absorb`
and run `git absorb` — it heuristically routes hunks to ancestors.

---

## Recipe 3: Reorder two commits in a stack

```
# Move src and its descendants onto dest, leaving the rest.
git move -s <hash-of-src> -d <hash-of-dest>
```

In-memory by default. If conflicts surface, add `--merge` to resolve them
interactively, or `--on-disk` if you also need a working-copy checkout.

---

## Recipe 4: Split a too-large commit

```
git split <hash-of-large-commit>
# Interactively select hunks; result becomes a child commit by default.
# Use --before to make extracted hunks the parent, --detach for siblings.
```

---

## Recipe 5: Rebase entire stack onto updated main

Canonical:

```
git sync --pull
```

Fetches `origin/main`, then rebases every local stack in-memory. Stacks with
conflicts are skipped — read the summary line for any `skipped` entries.

To resolve skipped stacks:

```
git sync --pull --merge        # interactive resolution for all conflicts
# or, target one stack:
git move -b 'stack()' -d origin/main --merge
```

---

## Recipe 6: Recover from a bad operation

```
git undo -i
```

Browse repo states with arrow keys; press Enter to restore. Recovers
botched rebases, deleted branches, hidden commits, and amended commits.

What `git undo` cannot recover:

- Untracked files that were never committed and never snapshotted.
- The middle of an in-progress merge conflict — abort the merge first.

If `branchless.undo.createSnapshots=false` was set, working-copy state is
not preserved. Verify the config before relying on undo for uncommitted work.

---

## Recipe 7: Hide experimental commits

```
git hide <hash>             # single commit
git hide -r <root>          # subtree
```

Branches pointing at the hidden commit are deleted by default.
Override:

```
git hide -r --no-delete-branches <root>
```

Reverse with `git unhide` (or `git undo` to roll back the whole hide
transaction).

Anti-pattern this replaces: `git branch -D` to discard work, or
`git reset --hard` to wipe local history. Both lose the event log.

---

## Recipe 8: Test every commit in a stack

The revset is a positional argument to `git test run`, not a flag.

```
git test run --exec 'cargo test' 'stack()'
```

Find the first failing commit fast:

```
git test run --exec 'cargo test' --search binary 'stack()'
```

Parallelize over CPUs:

```
git test run --exec 'cargo test' --jobs 0 'stack()'
```

Inspect cached results:

```
git test show -c 'cargo test' 'stack()'
```

Environment available to the command: `BRANCHLESS_TEST_COMMIT`,
`BRANCHLESS_TEST_COMMAND`.

---

## Recipe 9: Publish / land

Plain-git analogue: stay current → publish → drop merged locals → optional reclaim.
Branchless: `git sync --pull` → `git submit` (feature) or stock push (gated main) → `git hide` → optional `git gc`.

Wiki: <https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Command:-git-submit>,
<https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Command:-git-sync>,
<https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Advanced-topic:-garbage-collection>

### Gate

| Condition | Path |
|-----------|------|
| User requested push/ship to **main**, **or** HEAD is on local `main`/`master` | **Path M — Land main** |
| Otherwise (detached / feature / no main ask) | **Path F — Feature stack** |

**Never**

- Write `--force` / `--force-with-lease` in any publish step.
- `git submit` targeting `main` / `master` / `release/*`.
- Blind `git switch -C main` / `git branch -f main` without an ancestry proof.

### Shared preflight

```
git sync --pull
git sl
# Working tree clean. Read the skip summary; resolve with:
#   git sync --pull --merge
#   or git move -b 'stack()' -d origin/main --merge
```

### Path F — Feature stack (default; prefer `git submit`)

Name the tip first (branch = publishing artifact), then submit the revset `@`
(branches pointing at the current commit). Official forms: `git submit @`,
`git submit -c` / `--create` for first remote create.

```
git branch feature/<name> @
git config remote.pushDefault origin   # once per clone if unset
# First publish (remote branch missing):
git submit -c @
# Later updates (remote branch already exists):
git submit @
# Open PR via gh / web UI when the forge is GitHub.
```

Notes:

- Default forge is `branch` (push branches only). Phabricator: add
  `--forge phabricator` when `.arcconfig` is present (or pass it explicitly).
- GitHub forge integration remains experimental; do not rely on it for PR
  ancestry. Path F still uses submit as the branch push tool.
- `git submit` **force-updates** existing remote feature branches by design.
  That is expected for stacks under review; it is **not** allowed for main.
- If submit is denied (protection on the feature branch), fall back to stock
  `git push -u origin feature/<name>`, still no force flags.

### Path M — Land main (gated only; stock push, never submit)

**Main-path proof** (after shared preflight):

```
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main @
# If that fails: print `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD`
# and stop. Do not force.
```

**M1 — Already on `main` / `master`**

```
git push -u origin main    # or master; never --force*
```

**M2 — Detached, main authorized**

Attach local main only via FF; never `-C` / `-f`:

```
git switch main
git merge --ff-only @      # fails → stop; use Path F + PR instead
git push -u origin main
```

If local `main` is missing: `git switch -c main @` then `git push -u origin main`
(create only). If local `main` is not an ancestor of `@`, stop — do not rewrite.

Divergent remote push reject: report left-right counts, re-sync / `git move`,
plain push again. Never force.

### Post-land / post-merge hygiene ("gc alike")

Always after a successful land **or** after a PR merge reaches remote main:

```
git sync --pull
git hide -r <merged-draft-tips>   # tips now in main()/public(); leave smartlog
# optional rare disk reclaim (not default):
# git gc
```

Branchless retains unhidden orphans; hide first, then stock GC may reclaim.

### Scenario index

| # | Situation | Commands |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Feature first publish | `git branch <name> @` + `git submit -c @` |
| 2 | Feature stack update | `git submit @` |
| 3 | Submit denied on feature | stock `git push -u origin <feature>` |
| 4 | On main, authorized | sync + ancestor check + `git push -u origin main` |
| 5 | Detached, main authorized | FF-only attach + stock push |
| 6 | Non-FF / diverge | stop + counts; no force |
| 7 | After merge | `git sync --pull` + `git hide` + optional `git gc` |

---

## Recipe 10: Edit an old commit's contents (three approaches)

The wiki documents three patterns; pick by trade-off.

### Approach A — direct amend + restack

```
git switch --detach <hash-of-target>
# Edit files.
git amend
# Descendants auto-restack in-memory.
```

Cheapest. Children are temporarily abandoned during `amend`; `git amend`
reparents them automatically. Build artifacts may be invalidated.

### Approach B — fixup-then-squash

```
git switch --detach <hash-of-tip>
# Make the fix at the top of the stack.
git commit --fixup <hash-of-target>
git move -s HEAD -d <hash-of-target> --fixup
```

Lets you test the fix at HEAD before committing it into the older commit.
Two operations instead of one.

### Approach C — commute upward

```
git switch --detach <hash-of-tip>
git commit -m "tentative fix"
# Move the new commit immediately after its target, then convert to fixup:
git move -s HEAD -d <hash-after-target> --insert
git move -s <hash-of-tentative> -d <hash-of-target> --fixup
```

Preserves the working-copy state of intermediate commits — useful when
build artifacts are expensive and you want to keep the upper part of the
stack stable.

## Decision rubric

| Goal | Command sequence | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Add a fix to a buried commit | Recipe 2 (`git commit --fixup` + `git move --fixup`) | One operation. |
| Rename a function across N commits | `git reword <revset> -m '...'` for messages; `git amend` per-commit for content | Auto-restacks each time. |
| Reorder two commits | `git move -s <src> -d <dest>` | In-memory; add `--merge` if conflicts. |
| Squash two commits | `git move -s <child> -d <parent> --fixup` | No interactive editor needed. |
| Split one commit into two | Recipe 4 (`git split`) | |
| Sync stack onto updated main | Recipe 5 (`git sync --pull`) | Read the skip summary. |
| Recover lost or wrong work | Recipe 6 (`git undo -i`) | Replaces reflog spelunking. |
| Discard a local-only experiment | Recipe 7 (`git hide -r`) | Soft delete; reversible. |
| Find which commit broke tests | `git test run --search binary --exec '<cmd>' 'stack()'` | Bisect via revset. |
| Publish feature stack | Recipe 9 Path F (`git submit -c @` / `git submit @`) | Prefer submit; stock push only if denied. |
| Land on main (gated) | Recipe 9 Path M | User asked main **or** already on main; never submit main. |
| Post-merge hygiene | Recipe 9 post-land (`sync` + `hide`; optional `gc`) | Hide before stock GC can reclaim. |
| Edit an old commit's contents | Recipe 10 (A, B, or C by trade-off) | A is default; C preserves intermediate trees. |
| Reflexive `git reset --hard <SHA>` urge against committed history | `git undo -i` instead | Event log preserves recoverability. |
| Reflexive `git rebase -i main` urge for stack edits | `git move`, `git move --fixup`, `git reword`, `git split` | Decompose by intent. |
