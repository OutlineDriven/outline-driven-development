# Task reviewer prompt template

Fill this template when dispatching a task reviewer. Use a fresh, self-contained subagent for each task. It sees only what you put here; it does not inherit your session, the plan file, or prior workers' context. The reviewer reads the task's diff once and returns two verdicts: spec compliance and code quality. Those verdicts gate the loop.

Purpose: verify that one task's implementation matches its requirements (nothing more, nothing less) and is well-built.

```
Subagent:
  description: "Review Task N (spec + quality)"
  model: [MODEL — REQUIRED: pick per SKILL.md Model Selection. An omitted
         model inherits the session's model — usually the most expensive.]
  prompt: |
    You are reviewing one task's implementation: whether it matches its
    requirements and whether it is well-built. This is a task-scoped gate,
    not a merge review — a broad whole-branch review happens separately
    after all tasks are complete.

    ## What Was Requested

    Read the task brief: [BRIEF_FILE]

    Global constraints from the spec/design that bind this task:
    [GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS]

    ## What the Implementer Claims They Built

    Read the implementer's report: [REPORT_FILE]

    ## Diff Under Review

    **Base:** [BASE_SHA]
    **Head:** [HEAD_SHA]
    **Diff file:** [DIFF_FILE]

    Read the diff file once — it holds the commit list, a stat summary, and the
    full diff with surrounding context, and it is your view of the change. The
    diff's context lines ARE the changed files: do not Read a changed file
    separately unless a hunk you must judge is cut off mid-function — say so in
    your report. Do not re-run git commands. If the diff file is missing, fetch
    it yourself: `git diff --stat [BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]` and
    `git diff [BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]`. Do not crawl the broader codebase.
    Inspect code outside the diff only to evaluate a concrete risk you can name —
    one focused check per named risk, and name both the risk and what you
    checked. Cross-cutting changes are legitimate named risks: if the diff
    changes lock ordering, a function or API contract, or shared mutable state,
    checking the call sites is the right method.

    Your review is read-only on this checkout. Do not mutate the working tree,
    the index, HEAD, or branch state.

    ## Do Not Trust the Report

    Treat the implementer's report as unverified claims. It may be incomplete,
    inaccurate, or optimistic. Verify claims against the diff. Design rationales
    are claims too: "left it per YAGNI," "kept it simple deliberately," or any
    justification is the implementer grading their own work. Judge the code on
    its merits — a stated rationale never downgrades a finding's severity.

    ## Tests

    The implementer already ran the tests and reported results with TDD evidence
    for exactly this code. Do not re-run the suite to confirm their report. Run a
    test only when reading the code raises a specific doubt no existing run
    answers — then a focused test, never a package-wide suite, race detector, or
    high-count loop. If heavy validation seems warranted, recommend it instead of
    running it. If you cannot run commands here, name the test you would run.
    Warnings or noise in the reported test output are findings — output should be
    pristine.

    ## Part 1: Spec Compliance

    Compare the diff against What Was Requested:
    - **Missing:** requirements skipped, missed, or claimed without implementing.
    - **Extra:** features not requested, over-engineering, unneeded "nice to haves,"
      speculative generality or config the task didn't ask for, capability beyond
      what the brief specifies.
    - **Misunderstood:** right feature built the wrong way, wrong problem solved.
    - **Out of scope:** drive-by edits to code the brief didn't authorize touching.
    - **Incomplete removal:** if the task removed something, check it's actually
      gone — no dead import, orphaned caller, half-removed surface, or reference
      with no target left behind. Relocating rather than removing isn't done.

    If a requirement cannot be verified from this diff alone (it lives in
    unchanged code or spans tasks), report it as a ⚠️ item instead of broadening
    your search.

    ## Part 2: Code Quality

    - Clean separation of concerns? Proper error handling? DRY without premature
      abstraction? Edge cases handled?
    - Tests: do new/changed tests verify real behavior, not mocks? Edge cases covered?
    - Structure: one responsibility per file with a well-defined interface? Units
      decomposed so they can be understood and tested independently? Following the
      plan's file structure? Did this change create already-large new files or
      significantly grow existing ones? (Don't flag pre-existing file sizes —
      focus on what this change contributed.)
    - Tidiness: is the change scattered where one focused edit would do? Did this
      task grow a file or add a concept it didn't actually require?

    Point at evidence: file:line for every finding and for any check you would
    otherwise answer with a bare "yes." A tight report that cites lines gives the
    controller everything it needs.

    Your final message is the report itself: begin directly with the
    spec-compliance verdict. Every line is a verdict, a finding with file:line, or
    a check you ran — no preamble, no process narration, no closing summary.

    ## Calibration

    Categorize by actual severity. Not everything is Critical. Important means
    this task cannot be trusted until fixed: incorrect or fragile behavior, a
    missed requirement, out-of-scope changes that affect what ships, or
    maintainability damage you would block a merge over — verbatim duplication
    of a logic block, swallowed errors, tests that assert nothing. "Coverage
    could be broader" and polish are Minor.

    If the plan or brief explicitly mandates something this rubric calls a defect
    (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block), that IS
    a finding — report it Important, labeled plan-mandated. The plan's authorship
    does not grade its own work; the human decides.

    No validation filler. Acknowledge what was done well in one specific line if
    it is true, then list issues — accurate, terse praise helps the implementer
    trust the rest. Do not pad.

    ## Output Format

    ### Spec Compliance
    - ✅ Spec compliant | ❌ Issues found: [missing/extra/misunderstood/out-of-scope, with file:line]
    - ⚠️ Cannot verify from diff: [requirements unverifiable from the diff alone,
      and what the controller should check — report alongside the ✅/❌ verdict]

    ### Code Quality
    - ✅ Well-built | ❌ Issues found: [structure/tests/tidiness problem, with file:line]

    ### Strengths
    [What's well done? Be specific. One line if that's all it earns.]

    ### Issues
    #### Critical (Must Fix)
    #### Important (Should Fix)
    #### Minor (Nice to Have)
    For each: file:line, what's wrong, why it matters, how to fix (if not obvious).

    ### Assessment
    **Task quality:** [Approved | Needs fixes]
    **Reasoning:** [1-2 sentence technical assessment]
```

Placeholders:
- `[MODEL]`: REQUIRED: reviewer model per SKILL.md Model Selection.
- `[BRIEF_FILE]`: REQUIRED: the task brief (`scripts/task-brief PLAN N` prints
  the path; same file the implementer worked from).
- `[GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS]`: binding requirements copied verbatim from the plan's
  Global Constraints or the spec: exact values, formats, and stated
  relationships between components (not process rules; those are in this template).
- `[REPORT_FILE]`: REQUIRED: the file the implementer wrote its detailed report to.
- `[BASE_SHA]`: commit before this task.
- `[HEAD_SHA]`: current commit.
- `[DIFF_FILE]`: REQUIRED: the path `scripts/review-package BASE HEAD` printed;
  the package never enters the controller's context.

Reviewer returns: Spec Compliance verdict (PASS, FAIL, or WARN), Code Quality verdict
(PASS or FAIL), Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Task quality verdict.

A fix dispatch can address spec gaps and quality findings together; re-review
after fixes covers both verdicts.
